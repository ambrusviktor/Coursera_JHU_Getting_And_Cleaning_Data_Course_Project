# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project Repo

Contains R code, codebook, and the FinalTidyData text file for the peer graded assignment.

## Files:
README.md:   describes the contents of the repo, and how to use each file

CodeBook.md: describes the data, code, variables used in performing this analysis

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analysis described in this 5 steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalTidyData.txt is the output of the final step
